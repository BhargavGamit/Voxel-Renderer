# Voxel-Renderer
A Voxel-Renderer used to convert sequence of 2D images into 3D model which can be viewed from any perspective.

//TODO Explain in detail  I have commented the code so it is easy to understand.  

###Description
This project takes 2D sequence of images as input and was designed mainly to produce a 3D model from 2D MRI scans.
Further more this code can be extended for various purposes by changing what to display.  
Input: 2D sequence of processed MRI images.  
Input images format: .png (32 bitdepth)  
Output: A 3D model which can be viewed by rotating it from perspective. 

###Sample output
Input: 2D sequence of heart cross section MRI images.
